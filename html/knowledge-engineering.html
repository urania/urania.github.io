<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<div class="subtitle">2008</div>
<p>In the year if Beijing Olympics, I entered my college year. I started my study in the College of Information Science, Beijing Language and Culture University (also known as “Mini UN”) as a student majored in Information Management and Information System. During these four years I learnt basic skills in Computer Science such as coding (C, C++, Java, C#, Perl, HTML, and SQL), data structure, system analysis and design, computer networks…, etc. These courses were really my mind opener! Later, I participated in some competitions such as The Challenge Cup Beijing University Students’ Entrepreneurship Contest and China University Computer Design Contest and gained so many inspirations from the process. Also, together with my teammates, I took my part in several academic or personal projects such as CinemaX Online Cinema Workflow Management System and Samemail.com. These things are tiny, yet I have been so passionate about them! They brought me into the world of Computer Science.</p>

<h3>WOL & XBRL</h3>
<div class="subtitle">2011-2013</div>
<p>After stepping into the world of bits and 3 years’ exploration in the field, I decided to choose Information Management as the area of my graduation project. I joined the laboratory of Information Technology and began my research in Web Ontology Language and eXtensible Business Report Language (XBRL). Enlighten by my tutor, Professor Jimei Li, I gained great interest in how to project information from the view of ontology web, and how “trivial” things such as entities, dimensions, taxonomies, etc., can eventually build up a delicate yet extraordinary landscape of data and information. We devoted to leverage China’s business reporting environment with XBRL and I got my first IEEE article published: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/it/2013/06/mit2013060036-abs.html">XBRL in the Chinese Financial System.</a> Encouraged by the curiosity of examining what level the business reporting system of our country was on, especially in the aspect of the most widely used China Accounting Standard, I designed and completed a <a href="#/">CAS Validator</a> based on entity extraction and mapping, using C# and SQL, as my graduation project.</p>

<h3>Concept Map & Knowledge Management System</h3>
<div class="subtitle">2012-2015</div>
<p>
Entering the years of graduate student, I accumulated a lot interests on the philosophy of Ontology Web: if we can manage to organize the things, real or virtual, in a good enough method, then we will be able to describe and “compute” the world or even teach the machine to do so. (To be continued)

<h3>Big Data & Knowledge Graph</h3>
<div class="subtitle">2013-2014</div>
<p>In May 2013 I stepped into Baidu and became an intern in Web Data (WD) Department. To simply explain what WD does: it has hundreds of people divided into 3 core groups, Spider, Web Data Mining, and Knowledge Graph; it is guarding the entrance of all the data flows running into Baidu, providing all the other business groups with services such as data washing, conceptual computing, crawling & mining, etc., and is responsible for the quality of the search engine and many other products, E.g., Baidu Map, Mobile Search… </p>

<p>At the very beginning I participated in search engine strategy optimization and worked on several specified programs, including Page Value and Popkit Page Type Identifier, getting to learn about Hadoop, Lua and Python in daily work. In November, significant change took place in Baidu’s technical & business strategies, and the concept of “knowledge search” gained a lot attention, again. WD was the perfect candidate to take this task since it has zillions of Internet Data crawled by Spider year after year, and processed by structured data platform day and night. Our journey of building the most intelligence, reliable and updated Knowledge Graph kicked off, and I luckily became one of the first two Knowledge Graph product managers. </p>

<p>Together with the R&D team composed of dozens of brilliant engineers, we tried to invent tools and algorithms for better gathering data and information in a massive amount and generating the valuable knowledge. We constructed a series of data process platforms for automatically collecting data and building an almost completed mirror of the Internet, then washing off the noises and garbage, then extracting entities and multi-dimensional relationships from within,… and then eventually entering the dataware of Knowledge Graph. Along the journey, I worked as the project owner of Baidu Schema and the leader of Visualized KG Search Program, dug into the algorithms of mapping and conceptual computation as well as entity recommendations, built prototypes of websites, and conducted the experiment of using graphical KG on the searching page in order to improve user experience not only by a new method of presentation but also the back-end entity emergence algorithm which can turn “unpopular queries” into desired ones.</p>

<p>In July 2014, the Visualized KG Search Program won 9th Hackathon’s top prize: The Black Horse Award; as the team leader, I spent couples of sleepless nights to realize the project with my teammates, and gave the improvisational presentation in front of Biadu’s E-staffs(CEO, CFO, CTO and other executive members of the Board). In the luncheon with Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, our projects was highly valued and obtained a lot support. In August, with the special offer of Baidu at hand, I decided to take a break gratefully with all the inspiration I got from Baidu, and try something new in a different area: Education.</p>

<h3>Education & Machine Learning</h3>
<div class="subtitle">Marching On</div>
<p>Started from my own Personal KMS Project based on Concept Map, I realized though drawing out these points and lines may seem to be simple, but the power is very potential. (To be continued)</p>
